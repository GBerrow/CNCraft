## Wireframes

The wireframe design process for CNCraft was conducted with meticulous attention to user experience, business objectives, and modern e-commerce best practices. I approached the design phase systematically, first mapping the full customer journey from discovery to purchase to create a seamless path-to-conversion.

My wireframes embody a user-centric philosophy, with careful consideration of information hierarchy, interaction patterns, and visual weight to guide users intuitively through the platform. Each interface element was strategically positioned to optimize both user engagement and conversion opportunities, balancing aesthetic appeal with functional clarity.

For responsive design, I adopted a mobile-first methodology, ensuring critical functionality and content maintains integrity across all devices while adapting thoughtfully to different viewport constraints.
